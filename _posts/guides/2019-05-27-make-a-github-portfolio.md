I haven't played with this in a while, but I suspect I need to do something in that portfolio to freshen up its view. All the same, I have the steps I took to get this far, right here:

## Step 1

Fork this repository:

* [github/personal-website](https://github.com/github/personal-website)

## Step 2

Go to settings and select publish from master branch:

## Step 3

If you already have a web-page, then maybe you aren't reading this.. Either way, you must name your repository as the same as your username (or the organizations name) on github. So my first website's repository name is [infominer33.github.io](https://github.com/infominer33/infominer33.github.io) since my github username is infominer33. Now it publishes to `infominer.id` (but also `infominer33.github.io`) because I have a custom domain, and every other repository I publish from my user account, rather than in an organization, is a branch of that first domain.

Since I already have a primary webpage, I change my repository name to `repo-portfolio`. That way, it lives at:

* [infominer.id/repo-portfolio](https://infominer.id/repo-portfolio/)

## Step 4

On github pages, `_config.yml` lives in the root directory of each webpage, this is where you can fine tune settings which repositories display:

```

projects:
  sort_by: pushed
  # sort_by options:
  #   - pushed
  #   - stars
  limit: 12
  exclude:
    archived: false
    forks: false
    projects:
      - pub-yes
      - yest
      - archive-crypto
      - yest-the-docs
      - bahamas-crypto

```


you can also configure social media accounts.

```
social_media:
  website: https://infominer.xyz/
  keybase: infominer
  telegram: infominer33
  twitter: infominer33
  # behance: your_username
  # dribbble: your_username
  # facebook: your_username
  # hackerrank: your_username
  # instagram: your_username
  # linkedin: your_username
  # mastodon: your_username
  # medium: your_username
  # stackoverflow: your_user_id
  # unsplash: your_username
  # vk: your_username
  # youtube: your_username
```
and topics of interest:

```

topics:
  - name: Bitcoin
    web_url: https://github.com/topics/bitcoin
    image_url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/bitcoin/bitcoin.png

  - name: Decentralized Identity
    web_url: https://github.com/topics/decentralized-identity
    image_url: https://decentralized-id.com/assets/icons/didicon.png

```

Cool beans, right?

There are also blog features, although I'm not sure I'll blog there... who knows!?!?

I haven't looked through the [issues](https://github.com/github/personal-website/issues), or [pull-requests](https://github.com/github/personal-website/pulls) yet to see what folk are working on, or tried to tweak any of the quirks I've noticed..

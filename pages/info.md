I'm not a fast writer, or even particularly good at it. However, I love to learn. I value reliable sources and am a patient editor. 

When working with a client, especially new clients, I ask plenty of questions, and show my progress, to ensure that I'm headed in the right direction.

I'm primarily interested in Webwork, Bitcoin, *decentralized identity*, cryptocurrencies, development, and tech trends. 

I'm also quite interested in [data science](https://www.csbtechemporium.com/deep-learning-revolution/), although not nearly as much as I am crypto.

>I aim to create content of the highest quality - relating complex subjects in a clear and concise fashion - supplying essential details, with quality sources for further study.
